            <p id="p-1">The theory of the cosmos integrates various disciplines, including astronomy, physics, philosophy, and <br> metaphysics. The following is an overview of different theories related to the cosmos:</p>

            <h2 id="h2-1">BIG BANG THEORY</h2>

            <P id="p-2">This is the most recent theory explaining the origin and <br> evolution of the universe. The Big Bang theory suggests that the <br> history of the universe began with the Big Bang around 13.8 <br> billion years ago. As a result of the Big Bang, time, space, and all <br> matter were created, leading to the expansion of the cosmos.</P>

                <h2 id="h2-2">Black Hole Theory</h2>

                <p id="p-3">Black holes form from the collapse of very massive stars. These are regions <br> where gravity is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape. Black <br> holes interact with nearby matter and can emit radiation.</p>

            <h2 id="h2-3">STRING THEORY</h2>

            <p id="p-4">String theory is one approach that seeks a unified description <br> of the physical world. According to this theory, we live in a <br> three-dimensional space on Earth, but the cosmos might <br> contain additional microscopic, non-material "strings" <br> (vibrating filaments) that are part of confined spaces with <br> <span id="span-1">different sizes and characteristics.</span></p>

            <h3 id="h3-1">Here are three key points about String Theory:</h3>

                <label id="label1" for="string theory1">Unified Description of the Universe: String theory seeks to provide a single framework that <br> explains all fundamental forces and particles in the universe, including gravity, <br> electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.</label> <br> <br>
